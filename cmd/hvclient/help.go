var helpDoc = `Usage: hvclient [options]

HVClient is a command-line interface to the GlobalSign Atlas Certificate
Management API (HVCA). 

Access to HVCA requires an account. At the time of account setup, GlobalSign
will provide a mutual TLS certificate, an API key, and an API secret which can
be provided to HVClient via a configuration file.

General options:

  -config=<file>        File containing configuration options and HVCA account
                        credentials. Defaults to $HOME/.hvclient/hvclient.conf.

Certificate request options:

  Key options:

    One (and only one) of -publickey, -privatekey or -csr must be specified to
    request a new certificate.

    -publickey=<file>   Public key to use for HVCA accounts which do not
                        require proof-of-possession of a private key.

    -privatekey=<file>  Private key to use for HVCA accounts which require
                        proof-of-possession by signing the public key.

        -gencsr         Generate a PKCS#10 certificate signing request (CSR)
                        for HVCA accounts which require proof-of-possession
                        with a signed PKCS#10 CSR. Useful when a user has an
                        HVCA account which requires this proof-of-possession,
                        but has no convenient way to generate their own CSR.

        -csrout         Output a PEM-encoded signed PKCS#10 CSR instead of
                        requesting a certificate from HVCA.

    -csr=<file>         PKCS#10 CSR to use for HVCA accounts which require
                        proof-of-possession with a signed PKCS#10 CSR.

    -generate           Use with -publickey, -privatekey or -csr to output
                        the JSON-encoded certificate request without actually
                        submitting it to HVCA. Useful for examining and
                        verifying the contents of a request before submitting
                        it.

  Validity period options:

    If all of these options are omitted, the request will default to a
    not-before time of the current time, and a not-after time of the maximum
    allowed by the account validation policy. Providing only -duration will
    default to a not-before time of the current time, and a not-after time
    of the current time plus the specified duration.

    -notbefore=<time>   The time before which the certificate is not valid. The
                        time format is 2016-01-02T15:04:05UTC. Defaults to the
                        current time.
    -notafter=<time>    The time after which the certificate is not valid. The
                        time format is 2016-01-02T15:04:05UTC. Defaults to the
                        maximum allowed by the account validation policy.
    -duration=<value>   An alternative to -notafter. The not-after time will be
                        calculated at the not-before time plus the specified
                        duration value, which should be in a flexible format
                        such as 10d, 30days, 24hrs, 8wk, 12w.

  Certificate attribute value options:

    At least one of these options should normally be selected.

    -serialnumber=<string>        Subject DN serial number

List-producing API options:

  A number of options listed above return a paginated list of results and a
  total count of items. The total count may be higher than the number of items
  shown if the total count is higher than the specified or maximum number of
  items per page. The remaining items may be retrieved by incrementing the page
  number in subsequent usages of the same option.

  The following options control the pagination:

  -from=<time>          The beginning of the time window, with a time format of
                        2016-01-02T15:04:05UTC. Defaults to 30 days prior to
                        the current time.
  -to=<time>            The end of the time window, with a time format of
                        2016-01-02T15:04:05UTC. Defaults to the current time.
  -since=<duration>     Used instead of -from and -to, this signifies a time
                        window from the specified duration in the past through
                        to the current time. The format is the same as for the
                        -duration option.

  -page=<int>           The page number. Defaults to 1
  -pagesize=<int>       The number of items per page. Defaults to 100.
  -totalcount           Show the total count of items in the population instead
                        of listing them.

Convenience options:

  -genrsa=<int>         Generate and output an RSA private key with the
                        specified bit size
  -encrypt              When used with -genrsa, prompt for a passphrase and
                        use it to encrypt the generated private key

Other options:

  -h                    Show this help page.
  -v                    Show version information.
